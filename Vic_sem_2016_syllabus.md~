Replacing “How something is made, with a view to finding out what it is”
with “How something is made, with a view to making it again” – the
Essence with the Preparation – is linked to an option that’s completely
antiscientific: in reality, the starting point of the Fantasy [of the
critic’s writing a novel] isn’t the Novel (in general, as a genre), but
one or two novels out of thousands.

-Roland Barthes, The Preparation of the Novel, Session of December 9,
1978, 13.

 This research-intensive honors seminar centers around two simple
central questions: *How are Victorian novels made?* and *How is
scholarship about Victorian novels made?* We will focus on the Victorian
novel as both a genre and a material object, examining it within the
context of the broader world of Victorian literature and culture in
order to examine the ways in which the Victorian novel was both product
and producer of its historical moment. We will explore the possibilities
for rethinking canonical twentieth-century theories representational
theories of novelistic realism, following a recent flourishing in
Victorianist criticism on referentiality in order to ask how Victorian
novels may be said to refer to the real worlds their authors and readers
inhabited. In order to study this theoretical question, we will turn to
the set of practices and processes through which Victorian novelists
gathered the things of the world into their novels: research. Reading
several major and minor Victorian novels, we will trace different forms
of evidence of the ways their authors searched sets of documents, took
notes, and organized information to perform research of all kinds in the
library and on the streets. We will examine the published and
unpublished commonplace books, notecards, papers, files, and marginalia
of Victorian novelists both canonical and forgotten along with published
descriptions of these novelists’ research practices and their
representations of research in the novels they wrote. We will engage
with criticism and theory from a number of fields, including book
history, theories of materiality, historicisms old and new, theories of
narrative and realism, genetic and textual criticisms, bibliometrics,
media history, and digital humanities.

This class will help you develop our skills in research in print,
digital, and manuscript or typescript sources; how to use and evaluate a
range of databases and digital tools; how to think about citation
practices as substantive and central to our work as scholars of
literature. It will asks to examine your own implicit and explicit
research practices and habits, and (in some cases) to experiment with
modifying them or developing new ones. This class will collaborate with
Nabil Kashyap, McCabe’s Librarian for Digital Initiatives and
Scholarship, as we learn to incorporate various computational elements
into our work, from the basics of plain-text authoring, citation
management, and keeping an open research notebook to using digital tools
to help us analyze individual novels and groups of novels. We will also
collaborate with  English Department Digital Fellow in Data
Visualization to conceptualize and realize a series of visualizations of
data drawn from individual novels and a larger corpus.

###Assignments

#### Outline and discussion facilitation
Four times during semester you will be responsible – in pairs - for
facilitating discussion of the week’s material, including (but not at
all limited to) all readings, seminar papers, close readings, critical
summaries, and research exercises. Please plan to read the week’s
materials, come up with a draft of the outline (in informal consultation
with other seminar members if you like), and post your draft outline by
Tuesday at 5 pm to our outline site (more on which in class).  On by
Tuesday evening, the rest of the seminar members will access the outline
and may add their own suggestions. Then on Wednesday at 10 am the
discussion leaders will meet with me briefly in order strategize and
finalize the outline. I will then provide copies for use in class. We
can certainly diverge from this outline, but it is useful for us to have
a general map of how you imagine the shape of the discussion might
unfold. The outline is an interesting genre in and of itself; we’ll talk
about its limitations and possibilities, its uses as a preparation for
class, as a map during class, and as an enduring artifact after class is
over. And I can provide examples from past seminars if you wish. The
outline is also (unlike your seminar papers, close readings, and
criticism summaries) a public document, which we will likely share in
some form. We will format all outlines in Markdown.

#### Seminar papers
You will write two  3-4 page single-spaced seminar papers over the
course of the semester; they are due to our seminar Dropbox (more on
which in class) by midnight the Monday before seminar.  The seminar
paper should usually (although this is a guideline not a requirement)
engage with at least one novel – making sure to include at least some
close reading of the novel - and one piece of criticism. I also
encourage you to bring in outside reading that seems relevant (though
make sure that you do this in a way that is attentive to the fact that
the rest of us will likely not have read your additional text(s)).

#### Close readings
You will write three 1-2-page single-spaced close readings of a few
sentences or a paragraph of one of our fictional texts over the course
of the semester; they are due to our seminar Dropbox (more on which in
class) by midnight the Monday before seminar.  See handout on “close
reading the novel” for guidance if you like.

#### Criticism summaries
You will write three 1-2 page (single-spaced) summaries of critical
readings; like the seminar papers and close readings, they are due as
Word attachments to our seminar Dropbox (more on which in class) by
midnight the Monday before seminar. These should usually include a brief
paragraph on the main claim and stakes of the reading, a more detailed
overview of the argument, a note if relevant on the writer’s style,
feeling, and tone, and particular mention (with page numbers) of
points/passages you think are especially important for our purposes
and/or require our critique. See handout on “reading criticism” for
guidance if you like.

#### Research notes
This is a research intensive seminar. By "research intensive," I mean
that in addition to reading and responding to the texts included on the
syllabus according to the terms and questions I put forward, you will be
learning to both ask and answer your own questions about the Victorian
novel. We’ll also attempt to reflect on the research process, looking at
our own assumptions about what research is and does as compared with the
research practices of Victorian novelists (among others).

#### Seminar archive and site
Together we will think abou elements of our work we may want to make
public.

#### Visualization collaboration

#### Labs and open workshops
Occasionally we will open our class’s labs and workshops to interested
outside parties. Feel free to invite friends, family, teammates, lab
mates, housecats, that guy who is always hanging out in the periodicals
reading room. More on this in class.

#### Tools
To start exploring and thinking about your individual and collective
process of exploratory research, knowledge organization, and
note-taking, we will use a range of technologies, and we have
significant support for installing them, using them, and thinking
critically about them from Nabil Kashyap. Our goal is to both use
digital tools to do humanities work and to use our finely-honed
humanities tools to both *critique* and *use* digital technologies.

#### Long/Senior Honors Study paper
I want us to think about the long paper as a piece that draws together
some of the various shorter writing pieces, research skills, and
projects you will work on over the course of the semester. The long
paper may draw on any aspect of the work you have done in the seminar;
it should include an original argument about one of our novels, respond
to the existing criticism of that novel, and incorporate original
research. A substantial 4-5 page proposal, including a research
organization and technology plan, and perhaps the beginning of the
paper, is due before March break, with a rough draft due soon after in
early April.  If you are in Honors, this will become your SHS paper. I
would like – but will not require because different students’ interests
and needs will vary – for this paper to incorporate some significant
original research.

#### Final written and oral exam
During finals period you will take a three-hour written exam; you may
use your notes and books. You will then take an oral exam during finals
period based on this exam, your long paper, and the entire semester’s
readings. This is separate from and in addition to Honors examinations.

#### Seminar break
Each of you will bring break a few times during the semester. Consult
with one another, and be creative! If this will be a financial hardship,
please consult me.

#### Reading and note-taking, technology
We wil use various technologies we will use to facilitate various forms
of individual and collective note-taking, writing, archiving, and
computational text analysis. In addition, we will use laptops
intentionally and strategically during some parts of class but not
others; more on this during our first meeting. Group leaders will be
responsible for thinking about if, how, and when to use technologies
like this in class. (If you do not own a laptop, no worries; we can work
around this.)

#### Extra meetings and other specific seminar-related times
In addition to our regular Monday afternoon meetings, we will take one
or two trips to a special collections library. We will discuss the
scheduling of these in class. In addition, please reserve Wednesday at
10 am to meet with me during the weeks you are in charge of discussion
and outline.

<em>This double-credit Honors seminar is a major commitment, and
requires a lot of work. I realize this, and look forward to working with
you all so that we can mutually make sure that we have the time and
space we need to do a good job while also fulfilling our other semester
commitments and attempting to be relatively happy people (or as happy as
we’re disposed to be).</em>

#### Accommodations for disability
I want to work to make sure that everyone in this class has the access
to the materials, resources, and support they need in order to learn
most effectively. You are always free to talk to me about your own
situation.  A key Swarthmore resource in this area is the Office of
Student Disability Services. Their accommodations policy is here: If you
believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact
Leslie Hempling in the Office of Student Disability Services (Parrish
113) or email lhempli1@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to
discuss your needs. As appropriate, she will issue students with
documented disabilities a formal Accommodations Letter. Since
accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please
contact her as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations
process, visit the Student Disability Service Website at
http://www.swarthmore.edu/academic-advising-support/welcome-to-student-
disability-service.  You are also welcome to contact me [the faculty
member] privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all
disability-related accommodations must be arranged through the Office of
Student Disability Services.

#### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a very serious offense. It includes both the direct
copying of the words of another person without crediting him or her and
paraphrasing the ideas of another person without giving credit. If you
have any questions about how to properly cite another person’s work,
please do not hesitate to ask me.

#### Attendance and due dates
Because this is a seminar, attendance is essential. Missing seminar
(except for cases of illness or true emergencies) is inadvisable.
However, if you are really ill, try to contact me ahead of time, but do
plan to miss class! <b>Again, because this is a seminar, deadlines for
seminar papers, critical summaries, and outlines are (again, outside of
serious emergency situations) firm, firm, firm.</b>Plan ahead.

#### Your Own Devices Policy
Because our class is intensively collaborative,  I will expect that you
will be focused on the texts and on your classmates. If it is your
experience that having a screen in front of you can distract you from
the work of being in class, please take measures to prevent such
self-distraction. (I like [StayFocused](http://www.stayfocusd.com); you
may like other programs or strategies.)
